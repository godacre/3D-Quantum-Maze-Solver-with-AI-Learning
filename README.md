You are tasked with creating a Python script that can solve a dynamically generated quantum maze using an advanced AI algorithm. 

CHALLANGE! HAVE FUN AND BE CREATIVE!

#### Description:
You are tasked with creating a Python script that can solve a dynamically generated quantum maze using an advanced AI algorithm. The maze is represented as a 3D grid of cells, where each cell can either be a wall (#), a path (.), or a quantum tunnel (Q). The maze has a start point S and an end point E. The goal is to find the shortest path from S to E using an AI algorithm that can learn and adapt to changes in the maze.

#### Requirements:
1. Maze Generation:
   - The maze should be generated randomly with a given size N x N x N.
   - Ensure that there is always a valid path from S to E.
   - Include quantum tunnels (Q) that allow teleportation to another Q cell.

AI Algorithm:
Implement an AI algorithm that can learn and adapt to changes in the maze.
The algorithm should handle mazes of varying sizes efficiently.
Use reinforcement learning (e.g., Q-learning) to improve the pathfinding over time.

Dynamic Obstacles:
The maze should have dynamic obstacles that can appear or disappear randomly.
The AI should be able to detect these changes and adapt its pathfinding strategy in real-time.

Visualization:
Provide a 3D visual representation of the maze and the path found by the AI.
Use a library like matplotlib, pygame, or mayavi for visualization.

Performance:
The solution should be optimized to solve the maze within a reasonable time frame for N up to 50.

#### Input:
- An integer N representing the size of the maze (e.g., N = 10 for a 10x10x10 maze).

#### Output:
- A 3D visual representation of the maze with the path from S to E highlighted.
- The length of the shortest path found.
- A log of the AI's learning process and adaptation to dynamic obstacles.

#### Example:
For a 5x5x5 maze, the input and output might look like this:

Input:
N = 5

Output:
Maze:

# . # . # .
. . . . # .
# # . # . .
. . . E . Q

Path Length: 12
AI Learning Log:
- Initial path length: 20
- Path length after 10 iterations: 15
- Path length after 20 iterations: 12
#### Additional Challenge:
- Implement a feature where the AI can predict the appearance of dynamic obstacles based on patterns it learns over time.
- Allow the AI to use quantum tunnels (Q) strategically to minimize the path length.
